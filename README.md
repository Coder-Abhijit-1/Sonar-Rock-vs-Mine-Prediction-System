# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
The Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction System is a machine learning project that predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a **Rock** or a **Mine**. This type of system is commonly used in underwater exploration and naval defense applications.

The model works by analyzing sonar signal data and classifying the object based on patterns learned from the dataset.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Identifying underwater objects accurately is critical for safety and navigation. Manually analyzing sonar data is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the classification process using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Use a labeled sonar dataset containing signal frequencies
- Preprocess and analyze numerical data
- Train a machine learning classification model
- Predict whether the input data corresponds to a **Rock** or a **Mine**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset consists of **60 numerical features** extracted from sonar signals
- Target labels:
  - `R` → Rock  
  - `M` → Mine

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the sonar dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train the machine learning model
4. Provide new sonar input data
5. Model predicts whether the object is a Rock or a Mine

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-System.git


2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash     jupyter notebook     ```
4. Run all cells in the notebook

---

## ✅ Results

The model successfully classifies sonar data with good accuracy and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in underwater object detection.
